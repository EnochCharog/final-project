          <b>Right in the heart of Baguio is Baguio's University.</b>
          <br /><br />
          The cool climate of Baguio City has never failed to entice students for
          the unique university life it promises. At the fore of this is one of
          Baguio's premier institutions of higher learning - the University of
          Baguio.
          <br /><br />
          Since its foundation on August 8, 1948, the University of Baguio
          has steadily made a name for itself as one of the summer capital's
          biggest universities with an average student population of 15,000.
          <br /><br />
          UB was granted an Autonomous Status by the Commission on Higher
          Education on March 11, 2009, the first non-sectarian university in CAR
          to be granted such.
          <br /><br />

      <img src="images/ub-at-a-glance-2.jpg" id="right-img-about" />
      <p id="second-p-about">
        This makes UB among the select 42 private higher educational institutions
        granted an autonomous status out of 2,000 throughout the country.
        <br /><br />
        Constantly abreast with the latest trends in its various fields of
        specialization, UB prepares its students for the ever-competitive world of
        work that awaits them after college. Its competent faculty, cutting-edge
        facilities, harmonious family culture, healthy campus politics, and
        wholesome intra-school competitions perfectly complement the cool climate
        of the country's summer capital, making learning fun and worthwhile.
        <br /><br />
        The University of Baguio welcomes students from all walks of life, races,
        and beliefs. Through its more than six decades of existence, UB has
        nurtured generations of students from Baguio City, the greater Cordillera
        region, the rest of the country, and at least 19 foreign nations.
